                I'll talk about what is probably one of the biggest open source projects written entirely in TypeScript: IO.italia.it, an app and a platform API that helps people interact with the national and local Government.
                <br/>
                <br />
                We started working on IO at the beginning of 2017, in two and half years we've written almost 60K lines (and counting) of TypeScript code between the mobile app (React Native) and the backend (Express and Azure Functions).
I'll talk about the history of the project, the technical and architectural choices we made, the libraries and the tools we use and we contributed to the community and how TypeScript helps us to write better, more solid and more secure code.

              As a growing startup with large JavaScript codebase we’ve made the transition to TypeScript and survived to tell the tale!
              It wasn’t easy to make the decision but only half year later we feel like the investment already paid off.
              We looked back and identified many Dos and Don’ts to talk about.
              <br />
              <br />
              It’s 2019 and TypeScript is the obvious choice for every new project. But if your codebase is JavaScript how do you make the switch?
  
              Facing a quarter million lines of code – a messy mixture of untyped or poorly flow-typed JavaScript – our team of 15 at productboard absolutely knew we wanted to make the switch, but the barrier to entry looked very high.
              
              A half a year later, 85% of the codebase is strictly typed TypeScript and our confidence over the code has increased tremendously.
              
              In this talk I’d like to share our experience and answer the following questions:
              <ul>
                <li>How we convinced management it was worth the effort?</li>
                <li>How we approached the migration and how we phase it?</li>
                <li>How we learned to best collaborate as a team?</li>
                <li>What we’d do differently next time?</li>
                  <li>We learned a lot along the way and are eager to share it with all the other teams, because we believe everyone deserves TypeScript!</li>

                Ever wondered what going full-stack TypeScript means for your day-to-day workflow? In this talk we’ll see how to exploit the TS type system and the io-ts library to provide a “full-stack type-safe” development experience for a project comprising a Node.js HTTP API and a single page web application.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this talk we’ll see how developing on the same language and technologies full-stack can lead to a smooth developer experience with strong assurances of correctness at build-time. I’ll present the awesome io-ts library by Giulio Canti and a few key concepts of the TS type-system, and we’ll build upon these to live-code a custom solution to meet our needs. We’ll also briefly discuss other related topics, such as JSON (de)serialization and API error handling, and compare what we obtained with other available solutions.

              Decorators is one of the most underrated features in TS. At the same time is one of the most life changing features. Once you get it your, life will never be the same. We will start from basics definitions and go all the way to advanced real life examples and use cases.
              <br />
              <br />
             Decorators are incredibly cool. They allow you to describe meta data directly in the class declaration, grouping everything in one place and avoiding duplication. Terribly addictive. Once having tried, you will use it forever However the decorators in TypeScript are not as simple as we would like. Working with them requires some skills.

                As programmers we use abstractions all the time, but do we ever care about their costs? In this talk we’ll benchmark several implementations of a small but significant piece of code, using different abstractions to make it “better” but also measuring their cost in several dimensions.
                <br />
                <br />
                In this talk we’ll focus on the cost of abstractions, and how they impact the quality of the resulting code.<br/>
                We’ll consider the following costs:
                <ul>
                  <li>computational complexity (CPU resources used)</li>
                  <li>code size (including eventual dependencies)</li>
                  <li>eventually memory usage</li>
                  <li>code complexity and maintainability (they should get better using abstractions)</li>
                  <li>cognitive overhead (how hard it is to understand the abstraction)</li>
                </ul>
                The piece of code we’ll use is small enough to be understood by the audience in a minute, but it is realistic and could be used in production both in a front end and in a back end.<br/>
                As abstractions we’ll gradually introduce types and functional constructs. Then we’ll also show a Rust implementation using the same abstractions (this is significant because the language claims to support “zero cost abstractions”), running both as native code and as a WASM module, and compare it to the Typescript one. Finally we’ll also investigate how AssemblyScript influences the costs.

                The AWS CDK is a software development framework to define cloud infrastructure as code and provision it through CloudFormation. The CDK integrates fully with AWS services and offers a higher-level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively. The CDK improves your end-to-end development experience because you get to use the power of modern programming languages to define your AWS infrastructure in a predictable and efficient manner.” You can build test and deploy a true Infrastructure as a Code architecture using Typescript. make Reusable code and enjoy the code completion feature of IDE’s to create your cloud Infrastructure.
